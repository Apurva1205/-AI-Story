      "I was strolling through the park, enjoying a beautiful day, when I came across a man sitting on a bench, writing in a notebook. I stopped to talk to him and he told me he was a famous author. He was in the middle of writing a new book and he was having a lot of fun with it. We talked for a while about his work and then he asked me if I wanted to go back in time with him to the 1920s. I was hesitant at first, but then I thought about how exciting it would be to meet a famous author from the past. So I agreed to go with him.\n",
